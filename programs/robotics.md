#Robotics
##Overview
Let's make robots! The Kids Hack Day robotics program will help you build your robotic creatures. Toghether, we will learn how to build their mechanical parts, how to program them and how to make them look cool!

##Codebender
[Codebender](https://codebender.cc/static/about) is an awesome tool that let's you program an Arduino (or any Arduino compatible board) directly from the browser. You won't need to isntall any programs and will be up-and-running in minutes! [Sign up](https://codebender.cc/register/) now and get started.

##Quirkbot
Quirkbot is our very own developement-board/toy-to-make-toys/maker-companion. It's brain works just like an Arduino, but it has a quirky body, that will let you controll it and connect it to crazy [Strawbees](http://www.strawbees.com) structures.

One of the many special things about the Quirkbot is how you program it. We created a special programming language (well, its more like a "style") that can be at the same time textual (like normal Arduino code) or visual (you program by dragging and dropping blocks and connecting them with lines). In that way it's easier to understand the logic without getting stuck with the syntax. For some people, programming visually will be easier, but for others the textual will fill more appropriate, the key is that it is flexible and will work for everyone.

At this moment, this programming language is in alpha stage (it's still very early on). There are still lot's of things to be done, but it is already usable, specially when combined with Codebender. [Try it now](http://quirkbot.herokuapp.com).

##Robots Ideas

###Balancing robots

####Simple

 - [Pendulum](http://letsmakerobots.com/robot/project/attiny85-light-seeker-balancing-robot)
 - [Balancing Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsnqP_Ir70)
 - [Gyroscope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsBnBMIeXeo)

####Advanced

 - [Inverted pendulum](http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Simple-and-Very-Easy-Inverted-Pendulum-Balancing/)

### Wheels
 - Make a solid 2 motor structure
 - Light Seeking
 
### Paper Mechanincs / Tentacle
 - Create basic templates for geometric shapes

### Walking
 - Two servor
 - Use Strawebees triangle for structure

### Light

### Magnetic
