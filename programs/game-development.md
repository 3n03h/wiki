# Game Development Program

## Overview

This is a program to teach basics of programming language and code structures to kids with already some knowledge on computer and Minecraft. Aspects like how to browse on internet, use their OS and install basic softwares are not in the scope even we'll end up improving their concepts and use of this items and many others.

The language to be used is Python and the core engine will be the Minecraft Pi Edition API.

This program will make use of mini-games inside Minecraft to develop their knowledge and perception
of code and game mechanics.

## Scope

We want the kids to learn:

- Basic code structures: Variables, flow, iteration and methods
- Object oriented simplest concepts
- Math concepts: Trigonometry, matrix, functions, logic
- Basic physics: Position, velocity, acceleration

While they do:

- Drawing 3D shapes with code
- Interacting with rendered draws
- Develop simple game mechanics

## Python and Minecraft

Because of the awesome past experience reported by parents, kids and partners of Kids Hack Day about kids experience of coding Python inside Minecraft, we'll use Minecraft as a game engine and sandbox for kids.

Basically Minecraft already provide controls, inventary, world rules, life management and many other aspects that could be frustrating to write from scratch for kids. We will focus on creating mini-games inside the world, sometimes changing its default rules.

Minecraft provide officially a Python API for their PI Edition, which runs only on Raspberry Pi. Also from past experiences, we noticed kids got frustrated by not being able to continue their learning experience at home and keep coding. This breaks totally the learning proccess. With a Bukkit server setup and a plugin called Raspberry Juice we'll provide them a way to keep developing their code and ideas at home with their natural environment.

## Method

### Innovation Club

Once a week a group of 10 kids will participate of a small class with the following structure:

- Concept introduction
- Demo and play
- Development
- Documentation

This isn't a strict structure nor order but a suggestion. Kids can jump or change the order except by the documentation exercice which is the main focus of this classes. Their programming skill and concepts will evolve mostly not in this classes but by trying and failing in their natural environments. They won't go out from the classes with knoledge but with memories of what the monitor said and what they did. Knowledge and learning will come by repetition and free exploration by themselves.

What is the focus on the classes are they get introduced, inspired and take questions. But we'll focus specially learn how to document their progress and research from other people's development progress reports.
