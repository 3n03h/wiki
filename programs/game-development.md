# Game Development Program

## Overview

This is a program to teach basics of programming language and code structures to kids with already some knowledge on computer and Minecraft. Aspects like how to browse on internet, use their OS and install basic softwares are not in the scope even we'll end up improving their concepts and use of this items and many others.

The language to be used is Python and the core engine will be the Minecraft Pi Edition API.

This program will make use of mini-games inside Minecraft to develop their knowledge and perception
of code and game mechanics.

## Scope

We want the kids to learn:

- Basic code structures: Variables, flow, iteration and methods
- Object oriented simplest concepts
- Math concepts: Trigonometry, matrix, functions, logic
- Basic physics: Position, velocity, acceleration

While they do:

- Drawing 3D shapes with code
- Interacting with rendered draws
- Develop simple game mechanics

## Python and Minecraft

Because of the awesome past experience reported by parents, kids and partners of Kids Hack Day about kids experience of coding Python inside Minecraft, we'll use Minecraft as a game engine and sandbox for kids.

Basically Minecraft already provide controls, inventary, world rules, life management and many other aspects that could be frustrating to write from scratch for kids. We will focus on creating mini-games inside the world, sometimes changing its default rules.

Minecraft provide officially a Python API for their PI Edition, which runs only on Raspberry Pi. Also from past experiences, we noticed kids got frustrated by not being able to continue their learning experience at home and keep coding. This breaks totally the learning proccess. With a Bukkit server setup and a plugin called Raspberry Juice we'll provide them a way to keep developing their code and ideas at home with their natural environment.

## Method

### Innovation Club

Once a week a group of 10 kids will participate of a small class with the following structure:

- Concept introduction
- Demo and play
- Development
- Documentation

This isn't a strict structure nor order but a suggestion. Kids can jump or change the order except by the documentation exercice which is the main focus of this classes. Their programming skill and concepts will evolve mostly not in this classes but by trying and failing in their natural environments. They won't go out from the classes with knoledge but with memories of what the monitor said and what they did. Knowledge and learning will come by repetition and free exploration by themselves.

What is the focus on the classes are they get introduced, inspired and take questions. But we'll focus specially learn how to document their progress and research from other people's development progress reports and the main channel can be Wikis and Youtube videos.

### Wiki

Minecraft gamers often go to foruns and Wikis to find information. Minecraft's Gamepedia wiki is so far the most rich and complete guide about the game you can find over the internet. We'll setup a wiki for the kids explore and improve a big database of knowledge, examples and references to develop mini-games inside Minecraft.

Not only for development reports but to show off their code, screenshots and video tutorials about coding inside Minecraft. This is an exercice of content creation and community development, since not only will teach kids to share but share in a very important format today: Wiki. Basically by learning how to create articles in our wiki they will also be allowed to apply the same skills to do the same on Minecraft's official wiki and why not at Wikipedia?

### Youtube Channel

A common behaviour for kids and gamers is to screencast. From how to do simple tasks, cool tricks and very complex procedures, people (and kids also) love to get recognized by what they do. At the same time, it's very common for kids (and also adults) to search youtube tutorials instead long and exhaustive texts, even with pictures. There is nothing bad on it, actually this is more a resource than a problem! Let's push kids to report and document their development in videos as much they learn from videos from other kids!
